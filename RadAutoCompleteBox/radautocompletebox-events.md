The __RadAutoCompleteBox__ exposes almost all of the TextBox events. 
     Additionally, it provides the following events:

* __SelectionChanged__ - Occurs when an item of the RadAutoCompleteBox has been autocompleted. The event handler receives two arguments:

* The __sender__ argument contains the __RadAutoCompleteBox__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the RadAutoCompleteBox type.

* An __SelectionChangedEventArgs__ object.

* __SearchTextChanged__- Occurs when the text in the text box portion of the RadAutoCompleteBox changes. The event handler receives two arguments:

* The __sender__ argument contains the __RadAutoCompleteBox__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the RadAutoCompleteBox type.

* An __EventArgs__ object.
