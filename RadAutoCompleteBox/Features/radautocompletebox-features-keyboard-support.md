## Keyboard Shortcuts

Using the keyboard you can perform some of the most common tasks. This section describes the keyboard shortcuts used by RadAutoCompleteBox.

* Up - Navigates up through the items in the DropDown portion of the control.

* Down – Navigates down through the items in the DropDown portion of the control.

* Tab – Selects the highlighted item and loses the focus. If there is no suggested item just loses the focus.

* Enter – Closes the DropDown if it is open and selects the currently highlighted item.

* Escape – Closes the DropDown and deletes the last non autocompleted entered text.

>When an item is selected with the keyboard, it should be scrolled into the viewport and made visible.
