# Getting Started

To get started using Microsoft Azue, you will need to create a new account. You can choose to get a free trial account the benefits of which are listed [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Then, based on your needs, you need to create a separate account for the different services. The [following article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account) demonstrates how to create an storage account which we will then use to create to [integrate with the RadCloudUpload control]({%slug cloud-integration-azure-blob-storage%}).
