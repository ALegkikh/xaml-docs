# SDK Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadDragDrop__.

## List of all RadDragDrop SDK examples:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __[Drag drop between text box and another control](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/DragDrop/DragDropBetweenTextBoxAndAnotherControl)__ - This example demonstrates how to implement DragDrop between TextBox and other controls.
* __[Drag drop images](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/DragDrop/DragDropImages)__ - This example demonstrates how to implement repositioning image over a canvas with DragDrop.
* __[Using DragDropPayloadManager](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/DragDrop/DragDropUsingDragDropPayloadManager)__ - 
This example demonstrates main features of the DragDropPayloadManager as well as their usage within drag and drop between two RadListBoxes.
