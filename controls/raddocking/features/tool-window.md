# Tool Window



__ToolWindow__ is the container control that hosts all panes when in floating state. Every time you drag a pane and undock it, a new instance of the class __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Docking.ToolWindow__ is created to host that pane for you.

>

The implementation of the __RadDocking__ never requires you to work with __ToolWindows__ directly, rather than with the pane hosted inside. For example, to make a __ToolWindow__ not closable just set the property __CanUserClose__ of the hosted pane to __False__.

On the snapshot below you can see two ToolWindows with pane inside of each one.
