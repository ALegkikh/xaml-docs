# SDK Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadRichTextBox__.

## List of all RadRichTextBox SDK examples:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __[Change ribbons data context](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/ChangeRibbonUIDataContext)__ -  Change ribbons data context

* __[Custom floating block properties dialog](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomFloatingBlockPropertiesDialogDemo)__ -  Custom floating block properties dialog 
This example demonstrates how custom dialogs can be created and wired to work with the commands of the editor using MEF. The FloatingBlockProperties dialog is invoked from the context menu when clicking on an image and selecting the Text Wrapping -&gt; More Layout Options option.
Note that all that is needed to have the commands of the editor use the custom dialog is to implement the respective interface and mark the class with the attribute [CustomFloatingBlockPropertiesDialog].
* __[Custom image editor dialog](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomImageEditorDialog)__ - This example demonstrates how custom dialogs can be created and wired to work with the commands of the editor using MEF.

* __[Custom insert hyperlink dialog](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomInsertHyperlinkDialog)__ - This example demonstrates how custom dialogs can be created and wired to work with the commands of the editor using MEF. Note that all that is needed to have the commands of the editor use the custom dialog is to implement the respective interface and mark the class with the respective attribute as [CustomInsertHyperlink].
* __[Customize paste](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomizePaste)__ - This example demonstrates how pasting can be customized in order to disbale and enable rich text paste. In addition to reordering the format providers, it is also possible to attach to different events of the format providers and their settings.
* __[Customize printing](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomizePrinting)__ - The example demonstrates how to print silently with given printer. When you specify a printer name, the printer with the provided name will print the provided document silently. If the printer with the chosen name is not found, the default printer is being used.
* __[Custom spell checking dialog](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/CustomSpellCheckingDialog)__ - This example illustrates how the default SpellCheckingDialog can be replaced by a custom one.
* __[Data binding](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/DataBinding)__ - The current example demonstrates how you can bind the contents of RadRichTextBox to a property of your data source using the XamlDataProvider. More on format providers you can find here: http://www.telerik.com/help/wpf/radrichtextbox-features-data-providers.html.
* __[Drag and drop in editor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/DragAndDropRRTB)__ -  Drag and drop in editor  This example demonstrates the way DragAndDropManager can be used with RadRichTextBox.

* __[Getting started](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/GettingStarted)__ - The sample demonstrates the basic scenario where you create a document from code and edit its formatting. It also complies with the Getting Started article.
* __[Localization](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/Localization)__ - The example shows how RadRichTextBox along with the predefined UI of the control can be localized. The RadRichTextBoxResources file contains all localizable strings. More about the approaches for localization you can find here: http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/radrichtextbox-localization.html. 
* __[Mail merge](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/MailMerge)__ - This example illustrates the Mail Merge functionality of the control. The item source of the document contains information for the person sending the document, along with its picture.
* __[Merge documents](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/MergeDocuments)__ - This example demonstrates how multiple documents can be merged into one. After inserting each fragment in the merged document, the properties of the last section of the inserted piece are copied. This is done due to the fact that InsertFragment() does not copy the properties of the last section, but works as would copy/pasting do - places the caret after the inserted piece and takes the properties from the "large" document.
* __[Plain text editor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/PlainTextEditor)__ - The example demonstrates how to disable all rich-text editing capabilities and use RadRichTextBox as plain text editor.
* __[RadToolBar UI](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/RadToolBarUI)__ -  RadToolBar UI 
This example shows how RadToolBar can be used instead of the default RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI in order to achieve a simpler overall look. 
* __[Search and highlight](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/SearchAndHighlight)__ - This example demonstrates how the search and position functionality can be used to create a custom UI layer that highlights all occurrences of the searched text.
* __[Simulate watermark](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/SimulateWatermark)__ - This example demonstrates how you can strip the rich-text formatting options of RadRichTextBox and place text in it when the control is empty (similar to RadWatermarkTextBox).
* __[Telerik editor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/TelerikEditor)__ - This example demonstrates how the commands can be wired with RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI in order to be able to utilize all of the functionality of the control through a well-known user interface.
* __[Thread safe document conversion](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/ThreadSafeDocumentConversion)__ - This example demonstrates how DocxFormatProvider, HtmlFormatProvider, RtfFormatProvider and XamlFormatProvider can be used in a thread safe scenario for document conversion.
* __[Watermark](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/Watermark)__ - The example demonstrates how to create and apply a watermark from code.
* __[Windows metafile format image decoder](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/WindowsMetafileFormatImageDecoder)__ - This examples demonstrates how documents containing EMF or WMF images can be imported. It uses a custom WindowsMetafile image decoder class, registered later in the ImageCodecManager of the RadRichTextBox.
* __[Working with rad document editor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/WorkingWithRadDocumentEditor)__ - Working with RadDocumentEditor
This example demonstrates how to use RadDocumentEditor's API to create a document containing header, footer, numbered list, image, field and table of contents.
