# Styling and Appearance

This section is intended to give you broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of __RadToolBar__. There is also comprehensive information about the __ControlTemplate__ and its required parts. You will need this information if you want to customize the appearance of __RadToolBar__. 

You can modify the look of __RadToolBar__ either by changing some of the brushes exposed by the API, or change the __ControlTemplate__. In the __ControlTemplate__ you are allowed to reorder the template parts and your own objects. However, in changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.

>Note that in changing the __ControlTemplate__ you should include all required parts. Even thought your code will compile some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts.
