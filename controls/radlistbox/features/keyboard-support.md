## Keyboard Shortcuts

Using the keyboard you can perform some of the most common tasks. This section describes the keyboard shortcuts used by the __RadListBox__.

* __Up/Down__ - selects previous/next item.

* __PageUp/PageDown__ - skips 10 items, selects previous/next item.

* __Home/End__ - selects first/last item.

>Navigation always starts from the currently selected item. If there is no selection the navigation should start from the first item.
      	

>When an item is selected with the keyboard it should be scrolled into the viewport and made visible.
