# Keyboard Support

Using the keyboard you can perform some of the most common tasks. This section describes the keyboard shortcuts used by the __RadListBox__.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

* __Up/Down__: Selects the previous/next item.

* __PageUp/PageDown__: Selects the first/last item in the viewport or selects the previous/next item if all items are in the viewport.

* __Home/End__: Selects the first/last item.

>Navigation always starts from the currently selected item. If there is no selection the navigation should start from the first item.
      	
<!-- -->

>When an item is selected with the keyboard it should be scrolled into the viewport and made visible.
