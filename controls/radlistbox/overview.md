{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}![Rad List Box Overview 010 SL](images/RadListBox_Overview_010_SL.png){% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}![Rad List Box Overview 010 WPF](images/RadListBox_Overview_010_WPF.png){% endif %}

Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadListBox__!

__RadListBox__ is a {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} control used to display a list of items from which the user can choose. The control has a number of advanced features like multiple selection, autocomplete, keyboard support, drag and drop, as well as full customization capabilities.

## Key Features:

* __Selection__ - RadListBox provides three selection modes - Single, Multiple and Extended. Check [here]({%slug radlistbox-features-selection%}) for more details.          

* __AutoComplete__ - when __RadListBox__ is in focus, the first matching item is selected while the user is typing. [Read more]({%slug radlistbox-features-autocomplete%}).          

* __Drag and Drop__ - take advantage of the built-in drag and drop support to reorder items or move them from one RadListBox to another. [Read more]({%slug radlistbox-features-dragdrop%}).       

* __Silverlight/WPF Code Compatibility__ - the {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} ListBox shares a single codebase with its {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}Silverlight{% endif %} counterpart. This means that you can achieve close to 100% code reuse for your RadListBox logic if you have parallel Silverlight/WPF development.          

* __Expression Blend support__ - all controls from the UI for {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} suite can be easily customized using Expression Blend.          

* __Keyboard Support__ - __RadListBox__ supports several keyboard shortcuts for performing the most common task. [Read more]({%slug radlistbox-features-keyboard-support%})
