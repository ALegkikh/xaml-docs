# Change The Image Of The Application Button

The default look of the application button is an empty rectangular button similar to the one on the next snapshot.![Rad Ribbon View How To Hide The Application Menu Button](images/RadRibbonView_How_To_Hide_The_Application_Menu_Button.png)

When you want to add an image to the application button, you should use the RadRibbonView's __ApplicationButtonImageSource__ property. For more information about how to do that, read [
