# SDK Example



The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadHeatMap__.

## List of all RadHeatMap SDK examples:{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __Colorizers Categorical definition__ - This example aims to walk you through colorizers in categorical definition. The only difference between the Categorical and the Horizontal/Vertical definition is that in the Categorical only one colorizer at a time can be applied. Besides this, the colorizers behave in the same way

* __Colorizers Vertical definition__ - This example aims to walk you through colorizers in Vertical definition. In the scenario of Vertical Definition, the colorizer is defined in the MemberMappings of the corresponding definition.

* __Populating with data__ - This example aims to demonstrate the data binding feature of RadHeatMap. You can bind the RadHeatMap to any source that implements one of the following interfaces:   - IEnumerable - supports simple iteration of a collection. See the MSDN article for more on IEnumerable.   - ICollection - extends IEnumerable and supports size, enumerator, and synchronization methods for collections.   - IList - extends ICollection and is the base class for lists. {% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
