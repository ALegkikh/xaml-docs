# Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in the platform allows you to localize the Drag&Drop hints in the __RadTreeView__ control. 

Here is a list of the supported languages:

* English            
* German          
* Spanish           
* French
* Italian              
* Dutch             
* Turkish

>tipTo learn more about the ways to localize the RadControls please read the common topic on [Localization]({%slug common-localization%}).

## Resource Keys

You can localize the four __RadTreeView__ Drag&Drop hints. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, a unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of all of the __Resources__ available and their default values:

Key	|	Value
---	|	---	
TreeViewDropAfter | Drop after
TreeViewDropBefore | Drop before
TreeViewDropIn | Drop in
TreeViewDropRoot | Drop as root
