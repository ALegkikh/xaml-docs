# Styling and Appearance

This section is intended to give you broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of __RadMediaPlayer__. 

You can modify the look of __RadMediaPlayer__ either by changing some of the brushes exposed by the API, change its's exposed __DataTemplates__ or change the ControlTemplate. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and your own objects. However, in changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.

> Note that in changing the __ControlTemplate__ you should include all required parts. Even though your code will compile some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts.
