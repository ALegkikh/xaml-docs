# SDK Examples



The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadWindow__.

## List of all RadWindow SDK examples:{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __Alert with different icon__ - This example demonstrates how you could customize the template of the Alert and change the Alert Icon.

* __Restricted to parent__ - This example demonstrates how to restrict the RadWindow to the MainWindow in WPF and to the MainPage in Silverlight. The example is implemented to work with maximum of two monitors with the same resolution.

* __Save normal size and position__ - This example illustrates how to save the position and the size of the RadWindow in s normal state for Silverlight and WPF.{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
