# Localization



The built-in localization mechanism in Silverlight and WPF allows you to localize any string resource used by the standard __RadMap__ control. Once translated you might use your resources in both Silverlight and WPF projects without changing anything.

>tip__To learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about__ [Localization](http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/common-localization.html)__.__

## Resource Keys

__RadMap__ is a user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, an unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of all of the __Resources__ available and their default values:


|Key|Value|
|---|-----|
|MapAerialCommand|Aerial View|
|MapLabelsVisibleCommand|Show Labels|
|MapRoadCommand|Road View|
|MapBirdseyeCommand|Bird's Eye View|
|MapMapScaleKilometerFormat|{0} km|
|MapMapScaleMileFormat|{0} ml|
|MapPresetZoomLevelWorld|World|
|MapPresetZoomLevelState|State|
|MapPresetZoomLevelRegion|Region|
|MapPresetZoomLevelCity|City|
|MapPresetZoomLevelNeighborhood|Neighborhood|
