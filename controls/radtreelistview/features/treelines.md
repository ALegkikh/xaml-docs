# Connecting Lines



In order to offer a way of showing a multi-level hierarchy in a comprehensible way, we introduced __connecting lines__ for __RadTreeListView__. 

## 

The __tree lines__ support was added as of version __Q2 2014.__

__The functionality can be configured through the following properties:__

* __TreeLinesVisibylity__ – controls the visibility of the TreeLines. It is of type Telerik.Windows.Controls.TreeList.TreeLinesVisibility and its possible values are listed below:
            

* __Visible__

* __Hidded__

* __TreeLinesBrush__ – controls the Brush (Color) of the tree lines. It is of type __System.Windows.Media.Brush__

* __TreeLinesStrokeThickness__ – controls the thickness of the tree lines. It is of type __double__

Figure 1: RadTreeListView with tree lines visible. The TreeLinesStrokeThickness is set to 10.![Rad Tree List View Connecting Lines](images/RadTreeListView_ConnectingLines.png){% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
