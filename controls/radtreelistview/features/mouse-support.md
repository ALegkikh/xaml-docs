# Mouse Support



## 

__RadTreeListView__exposes several useful events, which can help you to control the mouse interaction and to get notified when mouse events occur. Moreover, by using the mouse you can perform some of the most common tasks:

* Change the __selection.__

* __Sort__ by clicking on the column headers.  

* __Expand\Collapse__ nodes. 

* __Resize__ and __reorder__ columns. 

* __Freeze\Unfreeze__ columns. 

* Define\Remove simple __filters__. 

* Start\End cell __editing.__

As the __RadTreeListView__ directly inherits the __RadGridView__ it handles the mouse in the same way. To learn more read the
