__RadSparkline__ is a set of controls that shows an information graphic. The controls are characterized by small size, excellent performance and lightweight. By definition, the sparkline is mainly used to outline trends, however, it is very flexible in terms of data points generation and can contain from just a few points, to as many as thousands of data points.

In terms of data visualization, RadSparkline is comparable to [RadCartesianChart]({%slug radchartview-overview%}), however, in order to maximize performance, the spark lines do not utilize this many visual indicators, as well as x or y axis, or multiple axes.

* __Horizontal axis__: The sparkline allows you to draw a horizontal axis that can be used to annotate the data trend. Read more about this in the [Axis]({%slug radsparkline-features-axis%}) article.
