# Sparkline Types

The sparkline suite contains several controls that provide different visualization for the plotted data. See how to set up those in the [Getting Started]({%slug radsparkline-getting-started%}) article.

* __Line__: You can display the data as a set of points connected by a line via the __RadLinearSparkline__ control.
