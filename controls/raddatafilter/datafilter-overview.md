__RadDataFilter__ key features include:
        

* __WPF/Silverlight Code Compatibility__

* __Visual Expression Building__ - with the extremely intuitive UI, __RadDataFilter__ is very user-friendly. Select your filter options with a simple point-and-click. The control allows specifying expressions based on the data and collection type of the source. You can build complex expressions on multiple fields with And/Or operators and myriad of filter functions.
            

* __Seamless Integration__ - __RadDataFilter__ can communicate with any kind of collections (even a plain IEnumerable). The control can then be bound to any ItemsControls (GridView, TreeListView, ComboBox, TreeView etc.) to the filtered endpoint called __FilteredSource__.
