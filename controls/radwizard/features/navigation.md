# Navigation

__RadWizard__ provides out of the box a basic sequential page navigation, which allows you to navigate through the pages linearly. With the help of RadWizard's events you can follow the state of the control at run time and implement custom pages sequence and page processing validation if necessary.

## Linear Navigation ##

RadWizardâ€™s navigation is enabled by default and it allows you navigating through the pages in linear order. By default, pages will be visited in the order that they are defined in its WizardPages collection.	

## Conditional Navigation ##

RadWizard provides the following events, which enable the implementation of conditional (not linear) navigation. 
* SelectionChanging
* SelectionChanged
* Previous
* Next
* Finish 
* Help 
* Cancel
