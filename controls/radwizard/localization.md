# Localization 
The built-in localization mechanism allows you to localize __RadWizard__ control.

Here is a list of the supported languages:

* English
* German
* Spanish
* French
* Italian
* Dutch
* Turkish

You can find more information on how to achieve this in the [Localization Using Built-in Resources]({%slug common-localization%}#localization-using-built-in-resources) article.

## Resouce Keys ##

In order to be able to distinguish the localization resources, a unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of the __Resources__ available and their default values:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Key</td><td>Value</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wizard_Cancel</td>	<td>Cancel</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wizard_Finish</td><td>Finish</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wizard_Help</td><td>Help</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wizard_Next</td><td>Next</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wizard_Previous</td><td>Back</td>
	</tr>
</table>
