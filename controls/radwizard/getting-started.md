# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains RadWizard control.

>note In order to use the __RadWizard__ control in your projects you have to add references to the following assemblies:
* Telerik.Windows.Controls
*	Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation
{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}*	Telerik.Windows.Data{% endif %}  

For the purpose of this example, you will need to open Visual Studio and then create an empty Application project.

## Adding RadWizard to the Project
You can add __RadWizard__ manually by writing the XAML code in __Example 1__. You can also add the control by dragging it from the Toolbox. 
__Example 1__: Adding a __RadWizard__ manually in XAML.

####XAML:

	 <telerik:RadWizard x:Name="radWizard" />

>noteThe telerik namespace is defined like so:
####XAML:
	xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
 
Now we can populate __RadWizard__ with some pages.
## Adding pages to RadWizard
 To add pages to __RadWizard__ you have to use its __WizardPages__ collection, which consists of __WizardPage__ elements. Here is an example of defining a page (__Example 2__): 

 __Example 2__: Adding a __WizardPage__ manually in XAML.
 XAML:
 
	<Grid>
	<telerik:RadWizard x:Name="radWizard" >
			<telerik:RadWizard.WizardPages>
				<telerik:WizardPage Content="My Wizard Page Content" />
			</telerik:RadWizard.WizardPages>			
		</telerik:RadWizard>
	</Grid>


Running the application (__Figure 1__) you will see the wizard page with its content and the page footer that contains all the predefined buttons.
