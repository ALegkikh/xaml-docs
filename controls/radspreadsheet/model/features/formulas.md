# Formulas



A formula is an algebraic expression that contains values, operators, functions, and references to cells. The following list takes a closer look to
        the compound parts of formulas:
      

* __Values__ - expressions in RadSpreadsheet can contain numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays. For example, all of the following
            formulas represent valid expressions that contain values of different type:
            *
              =3+4, ="Rad"&"Spreadsheet", =AND(TRUE, FALSE), =SUM({1, 2; 3, 4})
            *.
          

* __Operators__ - formulas can include arithmetic, comparison, cell reference, and text operators. Examples of expressions
            that use operators are:
            *
              =-1+2, =B1<=4, =SUM(A1:B4), ="Rad"&"Spreadsheet"
            *.
            More information about the supported operators can be found in the [Operators article ]({%slug radspreadsheet-features-formulas-operators%}).
          

* __Cell references__ - formulas can contain references to cells or ranges of cells. For example, the expression
            *=B1+B2 adds* the values of cells B1 and B2 of the current worksheet, while the formula
            *=SUM(B1:B5)* sums up the values of all cells between B1 and B5. Further information about cell references is available
            in the [Cell References article]({%slug radspreadsheet-features-formulas-cell-references%}).
          

* __Built-in functions__ - RadSpreadsheet offers a large set of predefined functions that can be directly included in expressions.
            Examples of formulas that use built-in functions are: *=ABS(-5), =COS(PI()), =AND(B1, B2)<>OR(C1, C2)*.
          

## Get and set formulas in cells

To set the value of a cell to a formula use the __SetValue()__ method of the __CellSelection__ class and
          pass the formula string as an argument. In order to produce a formula value the string you enter should start with either __=__ (equal)
          or __â€“__ (minus) sign, otherwise, the method will treat the input as plain text.
        

The following snippet creates a workbook from scratch and adds a worksheet. Further, the code assigns the value =3+4 to cell A1.

#### __C#__

{{region radspreadsheet-features-formulas_0}}
	            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
	            workbook.Worksheets.Add();
	            workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].SetValue("=3+4");
	{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadsheet-features-formulas_0}}
	        Dim workbook As New Workbook()
	        workbook.Worksheets.Add()
	        workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).SetValue("=3+4")
	        '#End Region
	
	        '#Region radspreadsheet-features-formulas_1
	        Dim formulaCellValue As FormulaCellValue = TryCast(workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).GetValue().Value, FormulaCellValue)
	        If formulaCellValue IsNot Nothing Then
	            Dim expression As RadExpression = formulaCellValue.Value
	            'expression is AdditionExpression with operands 3 and 4
	
	            Dim format As CellValueFormat = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).GetFormat().Value
	            Dim valueAsString As String = formulaCellValue.GetValueAsString(format)
	            'valueAsString = "=3+4"
	
	            Dim resultValueAsString As String = formulaCellValue.GetResultValueAsString(format)
	            'resultAsString = "7"
	
	            Dim valueType As CellValueType = formulaCellValue.ValueType
	            'valueType = Formula
	
	            'resultValueType = Number
	            Dim resultValueType As CellValueType = formulaCellValue.ResultValueType
	        End If
	        '#End Region
	    End Sub
	End Class



Additionally to entering formulas in cells, you can retrieve and inspect formula values. If you get the value of Cell[0, 0], the result will be
          an object of type __FormulaCellValue__. Just like other cell values, the __FormulaCellValue__ class inherits
          from __CellValueBase__ class and conforms to the __ICellValue__ interface. Thus, the class exposes several
          important properties and useful methods that allow you to get information about both the entered value and its result value.
        

A closer look at the value of cell A1 will reveal that the two methods __GetValueAsString()__ and
          __GetResultValueAsString()__ return the original string of the expression and string of the computed result, respectively. Similarly,
          the __FormulaCellValue__ offers information about the __CellValueType__ of its value and result value through
          the __ValueType__ and __ResultValueType__ properties.

	            FormulaCellValue formulaCellValue = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].GetValue().Value as FormulaCellValue;
	            if (formulaCellValue != null)
	            {
	                RadExpression expression = formulaCellValue.Value;
	                //expression is AdditionExpression with operands 3 and 4
	
	                CellValueFormat format = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].GetFormat().Value;
	                string valueAsString = formulaCellValue.GetValueAsString(format);
	                //valueAsString = "=3+4"
	
	                string resultValueAsString = formulaCellValue.GetResultValueAsString(format);
	                //resultAsString = "7"
	
	                CellValueType valueType = formulaCellValue.ValueType;
	                //valueType = Formula
	
	                CellValueType resultValueType = formulaCellValue.ResultValueType;
	                //resultValueType = Number
	            }
