# Accessing Cells of a Worksheet



Each worksheet consists of cells organized in rows and columns. In order to manipulate the data and properties of the cells, you need to create and
        use an instance of the __CellSelection__ class.
      

## 

As a worksheet contains a considerable number of rows and columns, it is unusual to perform an operation to the whole range of cells. Typically, you 
          would like to set the value of a single cell or, for example, apply formatting to a range of cells. In order to perform an operation on a specified 
          range of cells you need to create a __CellSelection__ object that holds the desired cell region and then invoke the appropriate 
          action for this __CellSelection__ instance. This class exposes a rich API that allows you to get, set and clear cellâ€™s value, 
          colors, borders and style.
        

__RadSpreadsheet__'s document model offers multiple ways to create a __CellSelection__ object. The 
          following list contains all approaches you can use to retrieve a __CellSelection__ instance. Note that each example creates a 
          new workbook, adds one worksheet and creates a selection for its cells.
        

1. Create CellSelection using CellIndex
            

#### __C#__

{{region radspreadsheet-active-cell-selection_0}}
	            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
	            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
	
	            CellIndex cellIndex = new CellIndex(0, 5);
	            CellSelection selection1 = worksheet.Cells[cellIndex];
	{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region radspreadsheet-active-cell-selection_0}}
	        Dim workbook As New Workbook()
	        Dim worksheet As Worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add()
	
	        Dim cellIndex As New CellIndex(0, 5)
	        Dim selection1 As CellSelection = worksheet.Cells(cellIndex)
	        '#End Region
	    End Sub

1. Create CellSelection using four integers that specify the CellRange
            

#### __C#__

	        '#End Region
	    End Sub

Once you have a __CellSelection__ object you can get, set and clear the properties of the selected cells. More information about 
          cell properties is available in the [Get, Set and Clear Cell Properties]({%slug radspreadsheet-features-formatting-cells%}) article.
