This control provides a rich user experience by allowing users to define various value formats, as well as additionally customize them to meet the customers' business requirements. The rich formatting options let users define different value formats. Besides the predefined numeric, percentage and currency formats, developers can also create their custom formats. __RadNumericUpDown__ also allows you to define minimum and maximum values to which the user can increment/decrement the input’s value. Additionally, you can specify the “change” that will be applied to the value upon each increase/decrease. The control can also be used in read-only mode in which the user cannot set custom values.

__RadNumericUpDown__ can be used in UpDown mode that uses paired arrow-buttons to increment or decrement a certain value, i.e. a scroll position or a number displayed in a companion control without showing a text box. To accomplish this feature you should set the __ShowTextBox__ property to __false__.

Moreover, __RadNumericUpDown__ can be fully declared both in xaml and code behind, and extensively customized in __Microsoft Expression Blend__. However, changing the control template of __RadNumericUpDown__ may impact its functionality in case some required parts are missed. For more details about required parts in the control template as well as appearance and styling you should refer to the [Styling and Appearance]({%slug radnumericupdown-styling-and-appearance-overview%}) section of this help.
