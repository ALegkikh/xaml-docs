# SDK Examples



The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadPdfViewer__.

## List of all RadPdfViewer SDK examples:{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __Change scale factor__ - The example demonstrates how to change the ScaleFactor of RadPdfViewer. In this case this is done in the DocumentChanged event and the set value will be used for each document shown in the viewer.

* __Context menu__ - The example demonstrates how to wire a context menu to RadPdfViewer.

* __Custom command descriptor__ - The example demonstrates how to add custom command descriptors.

* __Custom find dialog__ - This example demonstrates how to create a custom find dialog for RadPdfViewer. The dialog can be invoked with the Ctrl+F shortcut.

* __Custom presenter__ - This example demonstrates how to create and register a custom presenter for RadPdfViewer. When the buttons are clicked, the appropriate presenter is set.

* __Custom printing__ - The example demonstrates how to print silently with given printer. When you specify a printer name, the printer with the provided name will print the provided document silently. If the printer with the chosen name is not found, the default printer is being used.

* __First look__ - The example demonstrates how to bind the commands of RadPdfViewer to a RadToolBar. It also shows how to load a file from Uri or Stream.

* __Localization__ - This example shows how you can localize RadPdfViewer's UI.  The PdfViewerResources.resx file contains all localizable strings for the control.

* __Custom save command__ -  Custom save command  This example shows how a custom save command can be created which allows users can save the file they have previewed.
