__RadImageEditor__ is a control that can be used to preview and edit images in different file formats. It is meant to be used as a stand-alone control, but has also been integrated in __RadRichTextBox__.
         

The operations it can perform on an image are: 

* Crop 

* Canvas Resize

* Round Corners (including border)

* Hue Shift

* Saturation

* Contrast (and brightness) 

* Sharpen and Blur

* Rotating and Flipping

* Typing

* Drawing


The image formats it supports are: 

For import: 

* JPEG; 

* PNG; 

* BMP. 

For export: 

* PNG; 

* BMP. 

__RadImageEditor__ is highly extensible, so you can implement and utilize additional image editing tools, as well as import and export in other formats.
