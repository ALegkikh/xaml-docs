# Working with Data

In this article we will discuss the following topics:

* [Loading Data](#loading-data)

* [Displaying Data](#loading-data)

* [Managing Data](#loading-data)

## Loading Data

__RadGridView__ provides you with a variety of different ways to populate it with data, so it can display it. Here's a list of possible ways you can populate your RadGridView:

* [Using in-memory Data]({%slug gridview-in-memory-date%})

* [From XML]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-xml%})
 
* [From WCF Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-wcf-services%})

* [From ADO.NET Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-adonet-services%})

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

* [From RIA Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-ria-services%})

* [From Web Services]({%slug gridview-loading-data-from-web-services%})
{% endif %}

## Displaying Data

After you've acquired your data, all that's left to do is set it as the __ItemsSource__ of your RadGridView instance. The ItemsSource property takes any collection that implements **IEnumerable**.

>If you want RadGridView to correctly respond to changes in your collection and update the UI accordingly when you add or remove items through code-behind, the source collection should also implement the **INotifyCollectionChanged** interface. 

#### __[C#] Example 1: Setting RadGridView's ItemsSource__

	{{region gridview-working-with-data_0}}
	this.RadGridView.ItemsSource = SampleData.GetData();
	{{endregion}}

#### __[VB.NET] Example 1: Setting RadGridView's ItemsSource__

	{{region gridview-working-with-data_1}}
	Me.RadGridView.ItemsSource = SampleData.GetData()
	{{endregion}}

Once the __ItemsSource__ is set, RadGridView displays the data in the form of columns, which  will be auto generated by default. If you want, you could set RadGridView's **AutoGenerateColumns** property to **False** and [manually create them]({%slug gridview-columns-defining-columns%}#manual-columns-definition). You can find more information regarding RadGridView columns in [the following topic]({%slug gridview-columns-overview%}).

If you don't want to display all the data in one row you can use RadGridview's [Row Details]({%slug radgridview-row-details-overview%}) functionality to display the additional information.

If the data you want to display is hierarchical you can still display it in an appropriate format - in the form of nested __RadGridViews__. You can learn more about creating a **Hierarchical GridView** in [the following topic]({%slug gridview-hierachy-overview%}). 

## Managing Data

RadGridView comes with out of the box support for __Insert__, __Update__ and __Delete__ operations, as well as [data validation]({%slug gridview-managing-data-validation%}).

More information about [managing data]({%slug gridview-managing-data-overview%}) can be found in the following topics:

* [Updating an Entry]({%slug gridview-managing-data-updating-entry%})

* [Deleting an Entry]({%slug gridview-managing-data-deleting-entry%})

* [Data Validation]({%slug gridview-managing-data-validation%})
