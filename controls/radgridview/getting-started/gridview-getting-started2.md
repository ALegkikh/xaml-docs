This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains a __RadGridView__ control. This help article will show you how to:

* [Use RadGridView in your projects](#Adding_RadGridView_to_the_Project)

* [Bind your grid to a collection of custom objects](#Binding_RadGridView)

* [Generate columns automatically or specify them explicitly](#Grid_Columns)

* [Enable\disable the built-in sorting, filtering and grouping](#Sorting,_Grouping_and_Filtering)

The final result should look like this:

>In order to use the __RadGridView__ control in your projects you have to add references to the following assemblies:
					

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.GridView__

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input__

* __Telerik.Windows.Data__

For the purpose of this example, you will need to open Visual Studio and then create an empty Application project.

## Adding RadGridView to the Project

* Create a new project.

* You can add __RadGridView__ manually by writing the XAML code in Example 1. You can also add the control by dragging it from the __Toolbox__ and dropping it over the XAML.
            

* Make sure the required assemblies are referenced.

__Example 1:__ Adding a __RadGridView__ manually in XAML.
        {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

#### __XAML__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_0}}
	<Window x:Class="RadGridView_WPF_AR_7.MainWindow"
	  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
	        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
	        xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
	        Title="MainWindow" Height="700" Width="700"> 
	   <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White">
	        <telerik:RadGridView x:Name="radGridView" />
	   </Grid>
	</Window>
	{{endregion}}

{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

#### __XAML__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_1}}
	<UserControl x:Class="RadGridView_SL4_AR_26.MainPage"
	             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
	             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
	             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
	             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
	             xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
	             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignHeight="700" d:DesignWidth="700">

	       <telerik:RadGridView x:Name="radGridView" />
	   </Grid>
	</UserControl>
	{{endregion}}

{% endif %}

Two lines code from Example 1 are important here:

* First is the import of __Telerik__schema. 

#### __XAML__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_2}}
	xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
	{{endregion}}



* Second is the declaration of __RadGridView__ control. 

#### __XAML__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_3}}
	<telerik:RadGridView x:Name="radGridView" />
	{{endregion}}



* If you run the application (Figure 1) you will see an empty grid with no columns and rows. 

__Figure1__: The empty grid generated by __Example 1__.![](images/RadGridView_GettingStarted_2.png)

## Binding RadGridView

* In order to populate __RadGridView__ control with some sample data for this help article, you should create a new class named "__Employee__" and add several properties to it as shown in __Example 2__.
            

__Example 2:__ A simple Employee class with four properties.

>If you want to support two-way binding, your __Employee__ class should implement the __INotifyPropertyChanged__ interface and raise the __PropertyChanged__ event every time a property value changes.

* Next, you should create the "__EmployeeService__" class and implement a static method __GetEmployees__. For the purpose of this tutorial, it will return an observable collection containing several hard-coded employees. 
            

__Example 3:__ The EmployeeService class with the __GetEmployees__ static method contains hard-coded employee data.

* Now that you have prepared the needed sample data, it is time to bind __RadGridView__ to it. For that purpose, you should set the __RadGridView's ItemSource__ property to the collection of employees returned by the static method __EmployeeService.GetEmployees().__

#### __C#__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_8}}
	this.radGridView.ItemsSource = EmployeeService.GetEmployees();
	{{endregion}}



#### __VB__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_9}}
	Me.radGridView.ItemsSource = EmployeeService.GetEmployees()
	{{endregion}}



Now run your application and see the result (Figure 2).

__Figure 2: RadGridView__ bound to the collection of employees.
            ![](images/RadGridView_GettingStarted_3.png)

You can read more about data binding [here]({%slug gridview-overview-data-binding%}).

## Grid Columns

The __RadGridView__ from the example above contains four columns, one for each of the properties of the employee class.
          __RadGridView__ automatically generates these columns. If you want to stop the columns auto generation, set the __RadGridView__ property __AutoGenerateColumns__ to __False__ as shown in __Example 4__.
        

__Example 4:__ When the AutoGenerateColumns property is False, you will have to manually describe the columns you wish to be shown.
        

#### __XAML__

{{region gridview-getting-started2_10}}
	<telerik:RadGridView x:Name="radGridView" AutoGenerateColumns="False">
	    <telerik:RadGridView.Columns>
	        <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding LastName}" Header="Last Name"/>
	        <telerik:GridViewDataColumn DataMemberBinding="{Binding IsMarried}" Header="Married"/>
	    </telerik:RadGridView.Columns>
	</telerik:RadGridView>
	{{endregion}}



The code in Example 4 is shown in Figure 3. The XAML declaration of your __RadGridView__ contains two columns. The first one named "__Last Name__" is bound to the property __LastName__ and "__Is Married__" is bound respectively to __IsMarried__. As a result your grid control will have only two columns and no other column will be added because the property __AutoGenerateColumns__ is set to __False__.
        

__Figure 3: RadGridView__ with manually defined columns.
          ![](images/RadGridView_GettingStarted_4.png)

You can read more about __RadGridView__ columns [here]({%slug gridview-columns-overview%}).

## 
        Sorting, Grouping and Filtering of RadGridView are enabled by default.
      

[Sorting]({%slug gridview-overview-sorting%}), [Grouping]({%slug gridview-overview-grouping%}) and [Filtering]({%slug gridview-overview-filtering%}) of __RadGridView__ are enabled by default.

* You can [disable  sorting](430472AB-7C38-49AB-9E13-F4F0D1078EC0#Disabling_Sorting) for a specific column by setting its __IsSortable__ property to __False__. 
          

* You can [disable filtering](0CB2EC38-36E3-4BE5-AB56-85E07ACDD1CE#Disabling_Filtering) for a specific column by setting its __IsFilterable__ property to __False__ or the __IsFilteringAllowed__ property of __RadGridView__ to __False__. 
            

* You can [disable grouping](435984A5-EE5A-485B-9803-8A024F49EF11#Disabling_Grouping) for a specific column by setting its __IsGroupable__ property to __False__.
