# Filtering column showing DateTime values



## 
        Why do they disappear all when I filter and select a date?
      

Most probably your __DateTime data contains a time part which is different from 00:00:00__. When you filter and select a DateTime value, this selected DateTime will have its time part equal to zero if you forget to enter the time part. 
        

>Since DateTimeâ€™s with different time parts are not equal for the .NET Framework, you will have no match.
          

A possible solution would be to __trim the time part__ of your DateTimes. __Alternatively, you may instruct the user to enter both the date and time parts__ of the date when filtering.
        

An even better approach would be to __bind your column directly to the Date (or Year) property__ of the DateTime object. 
        

>tipFor example: DataMemberBinding="{Binding BirthDate.Date}"

As alternative solution, you can benefit from a property called __FilterMemberPath__. You can use it to tell the column to __filter on a property different from the one it displays__ in its cells.      
        

>tipFor example: FilterMemberPath="BirthDate.Date". You can also check the [FilterMemberPath documentation](88ca84b8-b237-4b2b-8823-5acef994788c#FilterMemberPath).
