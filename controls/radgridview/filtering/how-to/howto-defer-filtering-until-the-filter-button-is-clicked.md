# Defer Filtering Until the Filter Button is Clicked

When in Popup filtering mode, you can set the GridViewColumn.IsFilteringDeferred property to true. Filtering will be performed when the end user clicks the Filter button. The Clear button will immediately clear the column filter regardless of this setting.
