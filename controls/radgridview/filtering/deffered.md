# Enable Deferred Filtering

In case you would like the inbuilt __filtering__ of the RadGridView column to happen only when the user __clicks the filter button__, then you should set the __IsFilteringDeffered__ property of the column to __'True'__.

That way the filtering will be done after all the filtering criteria is specified and the user has clicked the filter button.
