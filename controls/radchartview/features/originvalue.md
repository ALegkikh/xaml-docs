# OriginValue

The different charts from the RadChartView suite expose a property called **HoverMode** which controls whether the rest of the series will fade out when a certain series is hovered. It is useful in situations with many overlapping series and has two possible values: **FadeOtherSeries** and **None**. The default value is **None**. This article will demonstrate this property with a RadCartesianChart.

> In the case of the RadPieChart, when the HoverMode property is set, all of the slices fade out except the hovered one.
