# SDK Examples

The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadChartView__.

## List of all RadChartView SDK examples:

{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __[Animations](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Animations)__ - An example that uses a utilities class and demonstrates how you can use animations for the chart series.
* __[Annotations adding](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/AnnotationsAdding)__ - Every chart contains an Annotations collection which holds all the annotations plotted against the chart. The RadChartView will visualize the annotations only if it contains data. 
* __[Annotation types](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/AnnotationTypes)__ - The ChartView provides the following types of annotations: Cartesian Grid Line, Cartesian Plot Band, Polar Axis Grid Line, Polar Axis Plot Band, Radial Axis Grid Line, Radial Axis Plot Band and custom Cartesian and Polar annotations. 
* __[Area series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/AreaSeries)__ - The area series can be SplineAreaSeries and normal AreaSeries which correspond to the SplineSeries and LineSeries respectively. The area series are behave just like the spline and line series but they also allow the area between the curve/lines and the corresponding axis to be colored in an arbitrary way.
* __[Axis](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Axis)__ - RadChartView plots data points in a coordinate system defined by its two axes. There are a few different types of axes and they are: Linear, Logarithmic, DateTime and Categorical.
* __[Bar series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/BarSeries)__ - RadChartView provides BarSeries out of the box. This series is used to visualize data points as bar blocks with the height of each bar denoting the magnitude of its value. The bars can be styled differently so that they can easily be differentiated from each other if necessary.
* __[Binding the color of series items](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/BindingTheColorOfSeriesItems)__ - This example will demonstrate how to create charts where each individual item has its color bound to a property of the underlying DataObject. The following chart series will be used for this example:   - Bar Series   - Scatter Point Series   - Pie Series
* __[Binding to data table](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/BindingToDataTable)__ - In this example we will demonstrate how to bind a ChartView to a DataTable. 
* __[Cartesian ChartGrid](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/CartesianChartGrid)__ - 
In order to improve the readiness of the chart you may want to add a grid-like visuals which support horizontal and vertical lines, associated with axis ticks and horizontal and vertical stripes for better readability. RadCartesianChart offers the CartesianChartGrid.
* __[Categorical axis](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/CategoricalAxis)__ - The categorical axis displays a range of categories and the values that determine each category do not define an order. If a category binding is not specified for the categorical axis, each data point will be in its own category with the category being determined by the position of the data point in the data source.
* __[Chart DataSource](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/ChartDataSource)__ - 
Aside from binding to a collection of business objects as shown in Create Data-Bound Chart topic RadChartView supports a more complex way of binding which allows you to combine the datapoints (known as sampling) before plotting them. This is done by using the ChartDataSource.
* __[ChartView customization](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/ChartViewCustomization)__ - 
The purpose of this example is to show different ways to customize the appearance of the chartview series. Some of them are easily customized via Fill, Stroke, Style exposed properties while others such as RadPieChart present you a more complex approach.
* __[Create chart with static data](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/CreateChartWithStaticData)__ - In this sample you are going to create and visualize your data using simple line chart. This line chart will be based on some predefined static data declared in XAML or code-behind.
* __[Create data bound chart](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/CreateDataBoundChart)__ - RadChartView supports data binding and manual population with data out of the box. The data binding feature is exposed by the different series and can be utilized by assigning a value to the ItemsSource property of a series object.
* __[Crosshair](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Crosshair)__ - This example demonstrates some of the options of the CrosshairBehavior.
* __[Customizing scatter points](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/CustomizingScatterPoints)__ - RadChart allows that you set custom shape for the Scatter points (items of the ScatterPoint series) via DataTemplate. However there are cases where we would like each point in our scatter series to have different shape or color. This is where you should use the PointTemplateSelector property. 
* __[Date time axes](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/DateTimeAxes)__ - RadCartesianChart supports two types of DateTime axes: 	- The DateTime continuous axis is like a numerical axis but the axis value range consists of DateTime values which are always sorted chronologically. 	- The DateTime categorical axis is a categorical axis with Date-Time values which are sorted chronologically and is represented by the DateTimeCategoricalAxis class. It also allows definition of categories based on specific date time components. For example if such an axis displays a range of one year, the data points can be plotted in categories for each month. If the range is one month, the values may be categorized by day and so on.
* __[Drag to pan and drag to zoom](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/DragToPanAndDragToZoom)__ - The sample demonstrates the different options you have to customizing the drag-to-pan and drag-to-zoom features. 
You can use directly the DragMode property which works only with the mouse Left button. 
You can also use the DragToPanKeyCombinations and DragToZoomKeyCombinations properties to customize the key combinations which start a drag-to-pan and drag-to-zoom operation.
These properties have a higher priority than the DragMode property.
* __[Drag to select](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/DragToSelect)__ - The chart view currently does not support built-in drag-to-select feature. This example demonstrates one approach to 
implement an application that mimics the drag-to-select functionality.
* __[Drill down](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/DrillDown)__ - The chart view currently does not support built-in drill-down feature. This example demonstrates one approach to 
implement an application that mimics the drill-down functionality.
* __[Individual axis zooming](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/IndividualAxisZooming)__ - The chart view currently does not support built-in zooming on individual axes. This example demonstrates one approach to 
implement an application that mimics the zoom-per-axis functionality.
* __[Introduction](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Introduction)__ - In this example we are going to create a chart from scratch using the chart related classes in the RadChartView control suite.
* __[Logarithmic axis](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/LogarithmicAxis)__ - The logarithmic axis displays values of items using intervals corresponding to orders of magnitude, rather than a standard linear scale.
* __[Multiple axes](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/MultipleAxes)__ - Additional horizontal / vertical axes can be specified through the CartesianSeries.HorizontalAxis / VerticalAxis properties.
* __[Pie series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/PieSeries)__ - The PieSeries are special series that are used to visualize data in the pie chart. Like all other series the pie series uniquely visualize its data point collection by representing different data points with pie slices. The sweep of a pie slices is directly proportional to the magnitude of the raw data point’s value.
* __[Plot mode](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/PlotMode)__ - RadChartView allows you to modify the layout of the Categorical and Date Time axes to improve the look and feel of the series presented. Depending on the selected plot mode, the axis's ticks and labels will be visualized differently. 
* __[Polar axis](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/PolarAxis)__ - In order to create a valid RadPolarChart object users must set its PolarAxis and RadialAxis properties to PolarAxis and NumericRadialAxis objects respectively. The PolarAxis class contains three properties and these are MajorStep, Minimum and Maximum which define the tick step, the minimum value and the maximum value of the axis. NumericRadialAxis does not define any properties specific to it.
* __[Polar ChartGrid](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/PolarChartGrid)__ - 
In order to improve the readiness of the chart you may want to add a grid-like visuals which support horizontal and vertical lines, associated with axis ticks and horizontal and vertical stripes for better readability. RadPolarChart offers the PolarChartGrid.
* __[Polar series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/PolarSeries)__ - The polar series consists of a group of classes that plot data in radial plot area in polar coordinates. The polar series are special because they are valid only in the context of the RadPolarChart control.
* __[Radar series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/RadarSeries)__ - The radar chart is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. The radar series are special because they are valid only in the context of the RadPolarChart control.
* __[Scatter series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/ScatterSeries)__ - RadChartView provides a group of scatter series that can be plotted on two linear axes unlike the other series which are always plotted on a categorical and a linear or another categorical axis.
* __[Scroll and zoom](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/ScrollAndZoom)__ - RadChartView provides zoom and scroll interactivity with the ChartPanAndZoomBehavior class. It is very simple to use and allows users to zoom in the chart plot area when there is a dense area of data points that can not be seen clearly at the normal chart scale.
* __[Scroll and zoom synced charts](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/ScrollAndZoomSyncedCharts)__ - Demonstrates one possible way to achieve synchronized zooming between two or more charts. Another possible way is to bind the Zoom and PanOffset of the two charts to properties in the same view model.
* __[Selection](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Selection)__ - This help example will demonstrate how you can make your charts more interactive by adding a selection behavior. Here are the main properties that ChartSelectionBehavior exposes:   - DataPointSelectionMode - to control single / multiple data point selection.   - HitTestMargin - to increase the hit-testable area around the data point (especially useful when visualizing small scatter points that can be selected).   - SelectionPoints - to detect the selection. You may also use the SelectionChanged event of the RadChartView for the same purpose.   - SelectionPalette - to control the selected element appearance. 
* __[Series provider](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/SeriesProvider)__ - This example demonstrates how to populate RadCartesianChart with dynamic number of series. The actual number of series created depends on the data chart is bound to. In this example the chart is bound to a collection of 3 SeriesProviderDataImte objects, hence 3 ChartSeries are created. Each of them contains 4 items, so each series ends up with 4 DataPoints.
* __[Spline series](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/SplineSeries)__ - The spline series are similar to the line series but instead of straight line segments, the spline series connects its data points with a smooth curve which represents rough approximations of the missing data points.
* __[Tooltip](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/Tooltip)__ - RadChartView provides a tooltip behavior which can be used to visualize arbitrary information related to a data point. The tooltip is triggered by setting the ToolTipTemplate property of ChartToolTipBehavior to a valid DataTemplate object during design-time and positioning the mouse cursor down somewhere on the chart during run-time. If the user hovers directly over a data point, the tooltip will display information for this particular data point. 
* __[Track ball](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/TrackBall)__ - Along with tooltip and pan/zoom behaviors, RadChart provides a trackball behavior through the ChartTrackballBehavior class. This behavior can display a vertical line across the chart plot area and also to display little visual indicators (circles by default) at points where the trackball line crosses the visualization of a series object. For example when the trackball line crosses a line series line segment, a small circle is drawn highlighting the value of the series at this point.
* __[Track ball like annotations](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/ChartView/WPF/TrackBallLikeAnnotations)__ - This sdk example demonstrates how to use annotations in order to achieve a TrackBall-Like effect. These annotaions can be synced between two or more charts and you can apply a custom behavior such as key navigation(left/right).
{% endif %}
{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
