Have you ever wondered how to save the properties of your UI elements with just one line of code? Do you need to load a previous visual state of an UI element? The __PersistenceFramework__allows you to implement such scenarios out-of-the-box. With its powerful save and load mechanism, it lets you save the UI related properties of your controls in a stream or an isolated storage so that you can retreive their values later. This way you can easily store the layout of your application thus keeping your users preferences.
