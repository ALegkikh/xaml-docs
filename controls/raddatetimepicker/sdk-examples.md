# SDK Examples



The [Telerik XAML SDK repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/) provides additional demos for most of the Telerik UI for {% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %} controls. The examples demonstrate many specific user case scenarios, that might be really helpful. In this article you can find the complete list of all SDK examples for __RadDateTimePicker__.

## List of all RadDateTimePicker SDK examples:{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}

* __Clear button__ - This example demonstrates how to customize the Template of the RadDateTimePicker Style in order to add a 'Clear selection' button to it.
The example is available for both Silverlight and WPF.

* __Custom HeaderTemplate__ - 
This example demonstrates how to customize the Header and HeaderTemplate of the RadTimePicker control in Silverlight and WPF.

* __Readonly input field__ - This example demonstrates how to make the input field of the DateTimePicker/DatePicker controls read-only while the drop down calendar  remains active for Silverlight and WPF.

* __Restrict the entered date__ - This example demonstrates how you can restrict the date that a user can type in the input field by implementing the ParseDateTimeValue event.
The example is available for Silverlight and WPF.

* __String format in MVVM__ - 
This example demonstrates how to set the Date/Time patterns using an attached behavior (i.e. in a MVVM-friendly manner).

* __Time intervals scroll viewer__ - This example demonstrates how to add a scrollbar to the time intervals portion of the control. When setting a small TimeInterval this  would help in not stretching the controls Tempalte for Silverlight and WPF.

* __Today button__ - This example demonstrates how to customize the Style of the DateTimePicker in order to add a today button to the RadDateTimePicker control for Silverlight and WPF.{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}
